The Gaming Room software design document

### The Client
The client was The Gaming Room and they wanted us to work on their game Draw It or Lose It. Draw It or Lose It was only created as an Android app, so The Gaming Room wanted to develop it as a web-based game to be available on multiple different platforms. Our job was to prepare a software design document which included comparing different platforms and providing recommendations on how to go about this process as well as develop part of the application and its security features.

### Design Approach
I would say I thought a lot about the user's needs and desires on how they would want the game to run when developing my design. I think this is most prevalent in my thoughts on memory management, specifically where I recommended splitting the game up into long but manageable segments for the users so they can get a break and do whatever while simultaneously giving the application time to load more pictures. Pauses built into the experience like this still make the game seem seamless and not as choppy. I actually found quite a few aspects helpful when thinking about the end result and how it would feel to play the game. Working through the design document narrowed my scope and ideas and got them onto one page to ensure I stayed on the right track and did not forget anything.

### My Thoughts
I believe the Executive Summary and Domain Model were the areas in that I felt the most comfortable and that my work was at the peak of my ability. One area I would probably redo given more time would be the comparison of different platforms. With all the other work I had going on, this was my least comfortable area as I felt I did not have the time I wanted to research each of these platforms in depth the way I would have liked to. With more time to revise, this would absolutely be the area I put the most work into.
